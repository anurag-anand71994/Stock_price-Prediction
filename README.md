# Stock_price-Prediction
It is a ML project based on time-series forecasting.
LSTM model is used.
In this project pervious 100 data values is taken to predict future 30 days values.  

STEPS:

1)Reading data in the form of csv file.

2)Preprocessing the data.

3)Splitting data into train and test split.

4)Creating a stacked LSTM model.

5)Calculating RMSE(root mean squared error) for performance metrics and test data.

6)Predicting the test data and plotting the output.

7)Predicting the future 30 days values and plotting the output.
